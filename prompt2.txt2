Create a professional 10-slide leadership presentation.

Title of the deck:
“Automated Behavior Manipulation Detection – Enterprise AI Pipeline for Compliance & Conduct Risk”

Style:
- Executive-ready
- Minimal, crisp bullet points
- Clean icons
- No technical jargon unless necessary
- Balanced visuals + text
- White background, modern design

Slides to generate:

---

Slide 1 — Title Slide  
Title: Automated Behavior Manipulation Detection  
Subtitle: Enterprise-Grade AI Pipeline for Compliance & Conduct Risk  
Prepared by: [Your Name]  
Date:  
Use a clean corporate-style header with simple icons.

---

Slide 2 — Executive Summary  
Include these points:  
- Manual review of 1600+ PDFs, chats, emails → slow, inconsistent, high effort  
- Risk of missing manipulative behavior (price manipulation, MNPI leakage, misleading communication, auction/system abuse)  
- Built a hybrid AI pipeline: scenario-based prompting, chunking, LLM classification, caching  
- Output: SME-ready Excel with labels & justifications  
- Impact: 70–90% automation, consistency, and audit readiness

Make this visually clean with 3–4 bold takeaway boxes.

---

Slide 3 — Business Problem  
Add bullets:  
- Manual review effort too high  
- Variable human judgment → inconsistent outcomes  
- No structured mapping of behaviors to findings  
- High risk of false negatives  
- Limited auditability  
Add a simple risk icon row at the top.

---

Slide 4 — Project Goal  
Bullet points:  
- Transform manual compliance review → proactive, AI-assisted workflow  
- Process 1600+ files reliably  
- Detect manipulative behavior with precision  
- Provide full justification for each clean or flagged chunk  
- Deliver SME-ready structured output  
Use a target/goal visual.

---

Slide 5 — End-to-End Pipeline Overview  
Use a horizontal pipeline layout with these steps:

1. **Data Consolidation**  
Convert all PDFs → one Excel with folder, filename, content.

2. **Chunking Layer**  
Break large text into small reviewable chunks.

3. **Prompt Engineering**  
Canon Scenarios (manipulation examples) + Few-shot examples.

4. **LLM Classification**  
Chunk → label → triggered scenario → explanation.

5. **Caching System**  
Cost-efficient, prevents reprocessing, handles network drops.

6. **Final Output**  
Excel/CSV: Chunk ID → Content → Classification → Scenario → Explanation → Filename → Folder.

Use icons for each stage.

Slide 6 — Pipeline Architecture (Visual Diagram)  
Create a simple left-to-right visual:

📁 Data (PDFs)  
↓  
📄 Consolidation (Excel file)  
↓  
✂ Chunking  
↓  
🧩 Canon Scenarios + Few-Shot Prompting  
↓  
🤖 LLM Classification

📊 Final SME Output

Clean, modern flow diagram.

---

Slide 7 — Example Output (Detection)  
Include TWO examples:

Example 1 — Manipulative Chunk  
Text: “Keep the price around 6.20 and don’t undercut the competitor.”  
Output:  
- Classification: Price Manipulation  
- Triggered Scenario: Coordinated Pricing  
- Explanation: Intent detected to influence pricing.  
- SME Action: Review

Example 2 — Clean Chunk  
Text: “Sharing the updated numbers.”  
Output:  
- Classification: Clean  
- Explanation: No manipulation, pricing hints, or MNPI.  

Use a split-screen layout.

---

Slide 8 — Key Strengths  
Use these points:  
- Explainable AI → every chunk has justification  
- Consistent behavior detection  
- Cost-optimized with caching  
- Scalable to large volumes  
- No external APIs; compatible with enterprise Copilot  
- Full audit trail  

---

Slide 9 — Business Impact  
Four pillars:

**Efficiency**  
- 70–90% automation  
- Faster SME review  

**Risk Reduction**  
- Lower false negatives  
- Stronger detection of subtle behaviors  

**Cost Savings**  
- Reduced LLM calls via caching  
- Fewer human hours  

**Regulatory Confidence**  
- Structured, auditable, uniform outputs  

Include simple icons for efficiency, risk, cost, trust.

---

Slide 10 — Roadmap  
Show as 3 phases:

**Phase 1 — Completed**  
PDF → Excel  
Chunking engine  
Canon Scenarios  
Few-shot prompting  
LLM classification  
Caching  
Final structured output  

**Phase 2 — Next 60 Days**  
Expand scenarios (20 → 100+)  
Dashboard & trend views  
Voice transcript support  
SME ticket triage workflow  

**Phase 3 — Vision**  
Bank-wide conduct surveillance  
Real-time chat/email/voice analysis  
Alerts & risk scoring  
Compliance command center dashboard  

Include a timeline visual.

Design Notes:
- Use icons for data, AI, classification, caching, and output.
- Keep text concise.
- Ensure each slide has a clear top-level heading.
- Executive-friendly language: short, sharp, outcome-driven.

Generate the full deck with the above structure.
