Problem (Compressed, Neutral Terminology)

Manual review of 1600+ documents & messages → slow, inconsistent assessments.

Need automated identification of unusual behavior patterns and communication risks at scale.

Solution Pipeline (Actual Workflow Followed)

1. Data Consolidation
All PDFs → Single Excel (Folder, File, Extracted Text).

2. Chunking Layer
Large text split into small, analyzable chunks.

3. Scenario-Driven Prompting

“Canon Scenarios” = realistic example situations to guide interpretation.

Few-shot examples teach the model the expected output style.

4. LLM Classification (Gemini)
Each chunk → Assigned category + scenario triggers + short justification.

5. Caching Layer
Processed chunks stored → prevents re-runs, reduces compute cost, handles retries.

6. Final Output
Unified Excel/CSV with all classifications for expert review.

Key Strengths

Consistent, explainable output (every chunk receives a justification).

Scalable & cost-efficient with caching.

Expert-ready structured summaries.

Output Format

Chunk ID → Text → Category → Scenario Triggered → Explanation → File → Folder.

Business Impact

70–90% automation of review workflow.

Faster expert validation cycles.

Higher confidence from standardized assessments.
